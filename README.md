###React - Social Media App 

This is a Social Media App completely developed using **REACT**.
This app is developed for learning purpose and I have only focussed on the UI part.

Thanks to @ZainRK for his clear explanation and methodology for the development of this REACT web application.

This project is actually a full stack **MERN project**, but  this project is focused only on the UI part .
This web application consist of :

- Authentication Page
- Home Page ( having Profile Section , Post Secition & Trending list )
- Profile Section for the management of profile data and posts

No validation procedures are implemented in this project , but the UI part is great.
For the detailed idea regarding the project , the project images are provided below :
